Download  the  script  CreateMyGuitarShop(available  on  canvas),execute  the 
script and study the structure of the database created.
2. Write a script that declares a variable and sets it to the count of all products in 
the Products table. If the count is greater than or equal to 7, the script should 
display a message that says, “The number of products is greater than or equal 
to 7”. Otherwise, it should say, “The number of products is less than 7”.
3. Write a script that uses two variables to store (1) the count of all of the products 
in  the  Products  table  and  (2)  the  average  list  price  for  those  products.  If  the 
product count is greater than or equal to 7, the script should print a message that 
displays  the  values  of  both  variables.  Otherwise,  the  script  should  print  a 
message that says, “The number of products is less than 7”.
4. Write a script that calculates the common factors between 10 and 20. To find a 
common  factor,  you  can  use  the  modulo  operator  (%)  to  check  whether  a 
number can be evenly divided into both numbers. Then, this script should print 
lines that display the common factors like this: 
Common factors of 10 and 20
1
2
5
5. Write a script that attempts to insert a new category named “Guitars” into the 
Categories  table.  If  the  insert  is  successful,  the  script  should  display  this 
message:
SUCCESS: Record was inserted.
If the insert is unsuccessful, the script should display a message something like 
this:
FAILURE: Record was not inserted.
Error 2627: Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 
'UQ__Categori__8517B2E0A87CE853'. Cannot insert duplicate 
key in object 'dbo.Categories'. The duplicate key value is 
(Guitars).
6. Excecute each of the scripts(2-5) and take a screenshot of the results.
7. Save all  scripts(text  and not screen shots) with their corresponding output in a single 
file and submit on canvas.
